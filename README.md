# Vistat

> This is a fork of the Vistat blog generated using [Poirot](http://github.com/ramnathv/poirot). You can modify the look of the blog by changing the framework in `posts/config.yml` to `purus`. It is trivial to add more themes as Poirot is highly modular

When we see fancy graphs in a paper or a webpage, we often wonder how they were made. 
This website serves as a gallery of statistical graphics and visualizations with reproducible 
program code that makes the plots.
